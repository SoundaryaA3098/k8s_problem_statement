I have a created a cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine.

And created the configuration of
	3 worker nodes ( each with 4 vCPUs, 15 GB memory and 100 GB Boot Disk Size)
	
In the cluster, I have done a blockchain-network setup.

Now, I have deployed a node-application in the pods in the cluster. My node-app involves about 5 services (so deployed in 5 pods)

worker node 1 consists of about 31 pods, worker node 2 consists of about 29 pods and 3rd worker node with 19 pods.

For each network components I have created pv, pvc of about 3Gi, 2Gi and 1Gi based on the requirements.

For node-app,
	I have deployed mongodb in one pod - For mongodb created pv, pvc of about 200 Gi
	And my node-app includes 4 other services which has pv,pvc of about 7 Gi
	
Now, I have checked the resource summary in 3 worker nodes:

WORKER NODE-1:

WORKER NODE - 3:

Can you please ellaborate how ephemeral storage and pv, pvc are connected. Do pv takes GB from worker node boot disk?
